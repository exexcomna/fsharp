## Method 1: Try Frequently-Used Passwords
 
Before you resort to any third-party software or online service, you should try some common passwords that may be used by the uploader of the RAR file. For example, you can try:

- The name of the uploader or user
- The name of the game or its abbreviation
- Some default numbers like 123456, 00000, 007, etc.
- Some personal information like birthday, anniversary, etc.

You can also check the comments section of the torrent site or source to see if anyone has shared the password or asked for it. Sometimes, the uploader may reply with the password or hint.
 
## Method 2: Use Notepad and Commands
 
This is a free and complicated way to unlock RAR password without any software. You need to create a batch file with some specific commands and run it on your computer. Here are the steps:
