Now that you have reset your toner, you may wonder how to check the toner level and how to replace the toner cartridge when it runs out. Here are some tips to help you with that:
 
## How to Check the Toner Level
 
The Samsung ML 1660 printer does not have a display screen that shows the toner level. However, you can check the toner level using the printer driver on your computer. To do that, follow these steps:

1. Open the Start menu and click on Devices and Printers.
2. Right-click on your Samsung ML 1660 printer and select Printing Preferences.
3. Click on the Maintenance tab and then click on Printer Status.
4. A window will pop up showing the toner level and other printer information.
5. You can also print a test page or a configuration report from this window.

## How to Replace the Toner Cartridge
 
When the toner level is low or empty, you will need to replace the toner cartridge with a new one. To do that, follow these steps:

1. Open the front cover of the printer and pull out the toner cartridge.
2. Unpack a new toner cartridge and shake it gently to distribute the toner evenly.
3. Remove the protective tape from the new toner cartridge and insert it into the printer.
4. Close the front cover of the printer and wait for it to initialize.
5. You can now print with your new toner cartridge.

Note: You should use only genuine Samsung toner cartridges for your printer. Using non-genuine or refilled cartridges may damage your printer or reduce its print quality. You should also dispose of used toner cartridges properly according to local regulations.
