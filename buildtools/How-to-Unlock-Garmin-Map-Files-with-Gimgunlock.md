Gimgunlock is a tool developed by wuyongzheng that can unlock Garmin map files in IMG format directly without splitting and joining. It has some advantages over other tools, such as:
 
- It is super fast. It can unlock a 2.3 GB image file in less than 4 seconds.
- It does not require any intermediate disk space. You can unlock a big image file on a SD card or USB connected GPS device directly.
- It preserves the original header of the image file. The timestamps, version number, mapset name, etc. remain the same.
- It runs on multiple platforms. You can use it on Windows, Mac or Linux.
- It is easy to use. You just need to drag and drop the image file over the icon of gimgunlock.exe and it will be unlocked.

To use Gimgunlock, you need to follow these steps:

1. Download Gimgunlock from [this link](https://www.navitotal.com/software/garmin-image-unlock-gimgunlock-t9369.html).[^1^]
